           <h3 class="pth3"> This module has challenged me a lot, when I joined the course, I had no prior coding experience, so it was a fresh start. I thoroughly enjoyed the graphic design element of the assignment. Looking at different graphic design principles to then create 3 compositions was what I found the most fun. Before starting this assignment, I didn’t know anything about graphic design, but it has become something I appreciate much more and look forward to using more in the future. It took me a while to learn how to use Figma to create the compositions, especially using the pen tool but after practicing and watching LinkedIn learning tutorials it became much easier to use. I believe that creating the compositions was the least challenging part of the work for me. 
            <br>
            <br>
Furthermore, implementing these graphic design principles into designing a website layout was another task in the project that I enjoyed. I think that after using Figma to create compositions allowed me to have a better understanding of the site which allowed me to quickly put together wireframes for my web design. I also found that having the Figma design made converting the website into code much easier. I didn’t think that I struggled with the bootstrap grid system and thought that it allowed my website to have the layout that I designed. In addition, figma also aided the CSS stylesheet with the use of dev mode, I was able to enter the exact characteristics of each feature to implement the same design into my code. 
<br>
<br>
GitHub was relatively simple to use and allowed me to work on my website from class and from home, I didn’t encounter any errors with each commit and push and helped me to retrieve any work that I needed to. 
<br>
<br>
I think that I could have improved my time management, I aimed to have the assignment finished earlier than I did but I don’t think that it impacted my work negatively. I also could have gone deeper with the layout design to make it appear cooler or funkier and challenge my coding skills further. But I look forward to expanding my knowledge later in the module.
